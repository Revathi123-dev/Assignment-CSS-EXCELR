      <h2>Section One</h2>
      <p>
        Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
         "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
         The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. 
         Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena
        The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".
         In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.
         The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus),
          and has steadily gained currency ever since.

      <h2>Section Two</h2>
      <p>
        During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.
        With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). 
        However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin
        Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. 
        Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. 
        It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.
         For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature".
          This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. 
          Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural..

      <h2>Section Three</h2>
      <p>
        From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. 
        Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. 
        Every part of nature – everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground – is interdependent.
         Medicine studies humans in health and sickness.
        From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict.
         People always use natural resources. They cut down trees, mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material. Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places.
          People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. 
          In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.
        Nature, in the broadest sense, means the physical world as a whole. This is the meaning that physics, the study of nature (etymologically), takes.
